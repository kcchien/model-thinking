Mental models for understanding complex, interconnected behavior. Based heavily on Donella Meadows' "Thinking in Systems."

## System Structure

### 1. Stocks and Flows
**Principle**: Systems have accumulations (stocks) changed by rates (flows).
- **Stock**: Bathtub water level, bank balance, inventory
- **Inflow**: Faucet, deposits, production
- **Outflow**: Drain, withdrawals, sales
- Stocks change slowly; flows can change quickly
- **Example**: Population (stock) = births (inflow) - deaths (outflow)

### 2. System Boundaries
**Principle**: What you include in the system determines what you see.
- Boundaries are mental constructs, not physical
- Too narrow = miss important connections
- Too wide = overwhelming complexity
- **Example**: Treating a company as isolated vs part of an ecosystem

### 3. Hierarchy and Subsystems
**Principle**: Complex systems are nested within each other.
- Cells → organs → organisms → populations
- Each level has its own purpose
- Higher levels set constraints; lower levels provide function
- **Example**: Company (divisions → teams → individuals)

### 4. Resilience
**Principle**: Ability to recover from disturbance.
- Not the same as stability (resistance to change)
- Built through diversity, modularity, redundancy
- Often invisible until tested
- **Example**: Ecosystem with many species vs monoculture

## Feedback & Dynamics

### 5. Reinforcing Feedback Loops (Positive)
**Principle**: Change in one direction amplifies itself.
- Compound growth, viral spread, arms races
- Leads to exponential behavior (growth or collapse)
- Requires external limit to stop
- **Example**: More users → more content → more users (network effect)

### 6. Balancing Feedback Loops (Negative)
**Principle**: Change triggers counteracting force toward equilibrium.
- Thermostats, hunger, market prices
- Creates stability and goal-seeking behavior
- Can oscillate if delays exist
- **Example**: High prices → less demand → prices fall

### 7. Delays
**Principle**: Time gap between action and consequence.
- Information delays: knowing vs reacting
- Material delays: shipping, processing
- Cause oscillation when feedback is delayed
- **Example**: Shower temperature overshooting

### 8. Dominance Shifting
**Principle**: Which feedback loop dominates changes over time.
- Early: reinforcing loop dominates (growth)
- Later: balancing loop dominates (limits)
- Transitions can be sudden
- **Example**: Startup growth slowing as market saturates

### 9. Oscillation
**Principle**: Systems overshoot and undershoot around equilibrium.
- Caused by delays in feedback
- Worse with longer delays or faster responses
- **Example**: Business cycles, boom-bust patterns

### 10. Exponential Growth
**Principle**: Constant percentage increase = explosive absolute increase.
- **Rule of 72**: Doubling time ≈ 72 / growth rate %
- Feels linear early, then suddenly overwhelming
- **Example**: 7% annual growth doubles in ~10 years

## Emergence & Complexity

### 11. Emergence
**Principle**: Wholes exhibit properties not present in parts.
- Consciousness from neurons, traffic from cars
- Can't be predicted from component analysis alone
- **Example**: Water's wetness doesn't exist in H or O atoms

### 12. Non-linearity
**Principle**: Outputs not proportional to inputs.
- Small cause → large effect (or vice versa)
- Thresholds and tipping points
- **Example**: One more straw breaks the camel's back

### 13. Chaos and Sensitivity
**Principle**: Small changes can produce vastly different outcomes.
- Butterfly effect in weather systems
- Limits long-term prediction
- **Example**: Slightly different initial conditions → divergent paths

### 14. Attractors
**Principle**: States the system tends toward.
- Point attractor: single equilibrium (pendulum at rest)
- Limit cycle: periodic oscillation (heartbeat)
- Strange attractor: chaotic but bounded (weather)
- **Example**: Organizations settling into routines

### 15. Path Dependence
**Principle**: History matters; current state depends on past path.
- Early random events lock in outcomes
- QWERTY keyboard, VHS vs Betamax
- **Example**: First mover advantage in standards

### 16. Self-Organization
**Principle**: Order emerges without central control.
- Flocking birds, market prices, Wikipedia
- Requires simple local rules + interactions
- **Example**: Ant colonies finding shortest paths

### 17. Adaptive Systems
**Principle**: Systems that learn and evolve.
- Agents change behavior based on outcomes
- Creates moving targets for intervention
- **Example**: Bacteria developing antibiotic resistance

## Intervention Points

### 18. Leverage Points (Meadows)
**Principle**: Places where small interventions yield large effects.

**From weakest to strongest:**
12. Constants/parameters (subsidies, taxes)
11. Buffer sizes (inventories, reserves)
10. Stock-flow structures (physical infrastructure)
9. Delays (relative to rate of change)
8. Balancing feedback strength
7. Reinforcing feedback gain
6. Information flows (who knows what)
5. Rules of the system (incentives, constraints)
4. Power to add/change rules
3. Goals of the system
2. Mindset/paradigm behind goals
1. Power to transcend paradigms

- **Key insight**: Most interventions target weak points (parameters)
- **Example**: Changing tax rate (weak) vs changing information access (strong)

### 19. Unintended Consequences
**Principle**: Interventions produce unexpected side effects.
- Systems adapt and compensate
- Feedback loops create counter-moves
- **Example**: Cobra bounty in Delhi increased cobra breeding

### 20. Policy Resistance
**Principle**: Systems push back against interventions.
- Each actor tries to maintain their goals
- Interventions get diluted or reversed
- **Example**: Price controls → shortages → black markets → higher prices

### 21. Shifting the Burden
**Principle**: Short-term fixes weaken long-term solutions.
- Quick fix provides immediate relief
- Underlying problem worsens
- Dependency on fix increases
- **Example**: Painkillers masking injury vs healing

### 22. Fixes That Fail
**Principle**: Solution creates new problem or worsens original.
- Delay between action and consequence hides link
- **Example**: Pesticides kill predators → more pests

### 23. Limits to Growth
**Principle**: Every growing system eventually hits constraints.
- Physical limits (resources, space)
- Institutional limits (management capacity)
- Growth shifts to balancing loop
- **Example**: S-curves in technology adoption

### 24. Tragedy of the Commons
**Principle**: Shared resources depleted by individual self-interest.
- Private benefit, shared cost
- Solutions: privatization, regulation, or norms
- **Example**: Overfishing, overgrazing, pollution

## System Archetypes Summary

| Archetype | Pattern | Intervention |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Limits to Growth | Growth slows unexpectedly | Find and address the constraint |
| Shifting the Burden | Quick fixes weaken fundamental solutions | Strengthen long-term solution |
| Fixes That Fail | Solutions backfire | Anticipate side effects |
| Tragedy of Commons | Shared resources depleted | Create feedback to users |
| Escalation | Each side trying to get ahead | Find mutual interest |
| Success to Successful | Winners keep winning | Provide equal opportunity |
| Eroding Goals | Standards slip under pressure | Hold the goal constant |
