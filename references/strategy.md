## Game Theory Foundations

### 1. Nash Equilibrium
**Principle**: State where no player benefits from unilateral change.
- Each player's strategy is best response to others
- May not be optimal for anyone
- **Example**: Both prisoners confess even though both staying silent is better

### 2. Prisoner's Dilemma
**Principle**: Individual rationality leads to collective irrationality.
- Cooperation > mutual defection, but defection dominates
- Changes when repeated (reputation matters)
- **Example**: Price wars, arms races, environmental degradation

### 3. Zero-Sum vs Positive-Sum
**Principle**: Games where total value is fixed vs expandable.
- **Zero-sum**: Poker, competitive sports (your win = my loss)
- **Positive-sum**: Trade, collaboration (both can win)
- **Example**: Negotiation is often positive-sum (create value, then divide)

### 4. Repeated Games
**Principle**: Future interactions change current incentives.
- Reputation becomes valuable
- Cooperation can emerge and sustain
- **Shadow of the future**: longer horizon → more cooperation
- **Example**: Business relationships vs one-time transactions

### 5. Tit-for-Tat
**Principle**: Start cooperative, then mirror opponent's last move.
- Simple, clear, forgiving
- Punishes defection but allows recovery
- **Example**: Trade negotiations, international relations

### 6. Chicken Game
**Principle**: Both want to avoid mutual destruction, but neither wants to swerve first.
- Commitment helps (remove steering wheel)
- Brinkmanship is risky
- **Example**: Labor-management standoffs, government shutdowns

### 7. Stag Hunt
**Principle**: Cooperation beats solo action, but requires trust.
- Hunt stag together > hunt rabbits alone > hunt stag alone (failure)
- Coordination problem, not incentive problem
- **Example**: Team projects requiring everyone's commitment

## Competitive Strategy

### 8. Moats (Competitive Advantage)
**Principle**: Sustainable barriers that protect profit.
- **Network effects**: Value increases with users
- **Switching costs**: Expensive to leave
- **Cost advantages**: Economies of scale
- **Intangibles**: Brand, patents, regulation
- **Example**: Google's search data network effect

### 9. Porter's Five Forces
**Principle**: Industry profitability depends on five competitive forces.
1. Rivalry among existing competitors
2. Threat of new entrants
3. Threat of substitutes
4. Bargaining power of suppliers
5. Bargaining power of buyers
- **Example**: Airlines (high rivalry, low differentiation) vs luxury goods

### 10. Relative vs Absolute Advantage
**Principle**: Compete where you're relatively better, not absolutely best.
- **Absolute**: Better at everything
- **Comparative**: Better relative advantage
- **Example**: Lawyer who types faster still shouldn't do typing

### 11. First-Mover vs Fast-Follower
**Principle**: Trade-off between pioneering and learning from others.
- **First-mover**: Define category, capture customers, build moat
- **Fast-follower**: Learn from pioneer's mistakes, better execution
- **Example**: MySpace (first) vs Facebook (fast-follower)

### 12. Blue Ocean Strategy
**Principle**: Create uncontested market space vs compete in bloody red oceans.
- Combine elements in new ways
- Target non-customers
- **Example**: Cirque du Soleil (circus + theater, no animals)

### 13. Disruptive Innovation (Christensen)
**Principle**: Simpler, cheaper products eventually overtake incumbents.
- Start in overlooked segments
- Improve until "good enough" for mainstream
- Incumbents can't respond (wrong business model)
- **Example**: Digital cameras disrupting film

### 14. Red Queen Effect
**Principle**: Must run just to stay in place.
- Competitors evolve; standing still means falling behind
- Continuous improvement required
- **Example**: Tech companies constantly innovating or dying

## Cooperation & Negotiation

### 15. BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)
**Principle**: Your leverage depends on your alternatives.
- Strong BATNA = walk away power
- Know your BATNA and estimate theirs
- Improve BATNA before negotiating
- **Example**: Job offer negotiation with another offer in hand

### 16. ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)
**Principle**: Range where deal is possible.
- Between seller's minimum and buyer's maximum
- No ZOPA = no deal possible
- **Example**: Seller needs $100K minimum, buyer pays max $120K → ZOPA = $100K-$120K

### 17. Integrative vs Distributive Bargaining
**Principle**: Create value before claiming it.
- **Distributive**: Fixed pie, zero-sum
- **Integrative**: Expand pie through trade-offs
- Different priorities = trade opportunity
- **Example**: Salary vs vacation days vs title trade-offs

### 18. Anchoring in Negotiation
**Principle**: First number strongly influences final outcome.
- Make the first offer if you have information
- Anchor aggressively but credibly
- Counter anchors with counter-anchors
- **Example**: List price sets expectation for negotiation

### 19. Commitment and Consistency
**Principle**: Once committed, people stay consistent.
- Get small agreements first
- Public commitments are stronger
- **Example**: "Do you care about the environment?" before asking for donation

### 20. Reciprocity
**Principle**: Give first to create obligation.
- Concessions invite counter-concessions
- Small gifts create disproportionate obligation
- **Example**: Free samples, favors before asking

## Strategic Positioning

### 21. Schelling Points (Focal Points)
**Principle**: Natural coordination points when communication limited.
- "Where would you meet in NYC?" → Grand Central
- Cultural and contextual
- **Example**: 50/50 splits as natural default

### 22. Commitment Devices
**Principle**: Constrain future options to strengthen current position.
- Remove retreat option
- Burn bridges, cross Rubicon
- **Example**: Publicly announcing deadlines

### 23. Signaling
**Principle**: Actions reveal private information.
- Costly signals more credible
- Education as signal (not just human capital)
- **Example**: Money-back guarantees signal quality

### 24. Information Asymmetry
**Principle**: One party knows more than the other.
- **Adverse selection**: Hidden information before transaction (used cars)
- **Moral hazard**: Hidden action after transaction (insurance)
- **Example**: Job interviews can't fully reveal employee quality

### 25. Option Value in Strategy
**Principle**: Keep options open; flexibility has value.
- Don't commit early without good reason
- Information arrives; optionality lets you use it
- **Example**: Wait-and-see on technology investments

### 26. Precommitment
**Principle**: Limit future choices to change others' expectations.
- Irreversible moves change the game
- **Example**: Building factory as commitment to enter market
