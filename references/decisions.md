## Core Decision Frameworks

### 1. Inversion (Jacobi)
**Principle**: "Invert, always invert." Solve problems backwards.
- Instead of "How do I succeed?" ask "How would I guarantee failure?"
- Avoid the failure paths to improve odds of success
- **Example**: To have a good marriage, list what destroys marriages and avoid those

### 2. Second-Order Thinking
**Principle**: Consider consequences of consequences.
- First-order: What happens immediately?
- Second-order: Then what happens?
- Third-order: And then what?
- **Example**: Price controls (1st: lower prices) → (2nd: shortage) → (3rd: black markets)

### 3. Probabilistic Thinking
**Principle**: Think in probabilities, not certainties.
- Assign likelihood to outcomes (70% likely, not "probably")
- Update probabilities with new information (Bayesian)
- **Example**: "There's a 60% chance this project succeeds given current resources"

### 4. Expected Value
**Principle**: Value = Probability × Outcome, summed across scenarios.
- Positive EV decisions should be taken repeatedly
- Consider both upside and downside scenarios
- **Formula**: EV = Σ(P_i × V_i)
- **Example**: A 10% chance at $1M = $100K expected value

### 5. Regret Minimization (Bezos)
**Principle**: Minimize long-term regret, not short-term discomfort.
- Project to age 80: Will you regret not trying?
- Errors of omission often hurt more than errors of commission
- **Example**: "Will I regret not starting this company at 80?"

### 6. Pre-Mortem (Klein)
**Principle**: Imagine failure has occurred, then explain why.
- Before starting: "It's a year from now, we failed. Why?"
- Surfaces risks that optimism masks
- **Example**: Team lists reasons the product launch failed before it happens

### 7. Two-Way vs One-Way Door (Bezos)
**Principle**: Distinguish reversible from irreversible decisions.
- **One-way doors**: Irreversible, need careful analysis
- **Two-way doors**: Reversible, decide quickly and iterate
- **Example**: Hiring = one-way; A/B test = two-way

## Cognitive Tools

### 8. Circle of Competence
**Principle**: Know where your expertise ends.
- Stay within your circle or expand it deliberately
- The edges are where mistakes happen
- **Example**: Buffett avoiding tech stocks he didn't understand

### 9. Occam's Razor
**Principle**: Prefer the simplest sufficient explanation.
- Don't multiply entities beyond necessity
- Simple explanations are more likely to be true
- **Example**: "The server is down" beats "coordinated hacker attack"

### 10. Hanlon's Razor
**Principle**: Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence.
- Most errors are accidental, not intentional
- Reduces unnecessary conflict
- **Example**: They missed the deadline from poor planning, not sabotage

### 11. First Principles Thinking
**Principle**: Reduce to fundamental truths and reason up.
- Question assumptions: "Why do we believe this?"
- Build from basic physics/economics/logic
- **Example**: Musk on batteries: What are raw material costs?

### 12. Falsifiability (Popper)
**Principle**: Good theories can be proven wrong.
- Ask: "What would change my mind?"
- Unfalsifiable beliefs aren't knowledge
- **Example**: "If sales don't improve 20% in 6 months, the strategy failed"

### 13. Devil's Advocate
**Principle**: Deliberately argue the opposite position.
- Appoint someone to challenge the consensus
- Surfaces hidden assumptions
- **Example**: Before acquisition, assign team to argue against it

### 14. Six Thinking Hats (De Bono)
**Principle**: Separate thinking into six parallel modes instead of arguing mixed viewpoints.
- **White** (facts) → **Red** (feelings) → **Black** (risks) → **Yellow** (benefits) → **Green** (creativity) → **Blue** (process/meta)
- Everyone wears the same hat at the same time, then switches together
- Always begin and end with Blue Hat; use Yellow before Black
- **Key rule**: One hat at a time — no mixing modes
- **Example**: Strategy meeting — Blue (agenda) → White (market data) → Yellow (opportunity) → Black (risks) → Green (solutions) → Red (gut check) → Blue (summary)

## Trade-off Analysis

### 15. Opportunity Cost
See [economics.md → #2 Opportunity Cost](economics.md#2-opportunity-cost) — foundational concept. In decision context: always ask "What am I giving up?" before committing resources.

### 16. Marginal Thinking
**Principle**: Evaluate decisions at the margin, not average.
- "Should we produce one more unit?"
- Ignore sunk costs; focus on incremental value
- **Example**: Marginal revenue vs marginal cost for next sale

### 17. Sunk Cost Fallacy
**Principle**: Past costs shouldn't affect future decisions.
- "We've invested too much to quit" is a trap
- Only future costs and benefits matter
- **Example**: Continuing a bad project because of prior investment

### 18. Asymmetric Risk-Reward
**Principle**: Seek situations with limited downside, unlimited upside.
- Lose $1 or win $100 = good bet at even odds
- Taleb's barbell: very safe + very risky
- **Example**: Small venture investments with 100x potential

### 19. Satisficing vs Maximizing (Simon)
**Principle**: "Good enough" often beats "optimal."
- Maximizing has diminishing returns and decision fatigue
- Set a threshold; accept first option that meets it
- **Example**: Hire first candidate meeting all requirements

## Time & Reversibility

### 20. Temporal Discounting
**Principle**: We undervalue future relative to present.
- $100 today feels worth more than $110 next year
- Counter by visualizing future self vividly
- **Example**: Retirement savings require overriding this bias

### 21. Commitment Devices
**Principle**: Constrain future choices to ensure follow-through.
- Remove the option to quit
- Odysseus and the sirens
- **Example**: Auto-deduct savings; delete social media apps

### 22. Option Value
**Principle**: Flexibility has value; don't foreclose options cheaply.
- Keep doors open when cost is low
- Irreversibility requires premium
- **Example**: Month-to-month lease vs yearly at slight discount

### 23. Weighted Decision Matrix
**Principle**: Score options against weighted criteria.
1. List criteria and assign weights (total = 100%)
2. Score each option per criterion (1-10)
3. Calculate weighted sum
4. Compare totals
- **Example**: Job offers scored on salary (30%), growth (25%), culture (25%), location (20%)

### 24. 10/10/10 Rule (Welch)
**Principle**: Consider how you'll feel in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years.
- Balances short-term emotion with long-term perspective
- **Example**: Quitting job in anger feels good (10 min), bad (10 months), depends (10 years)

### 25. WRAP Framework (Heath)
**Principle**: Widen options, Reality-test, Attain distance, Prepare to be wrong.
1. **W**iden: Consider more alternatives
2. **R**eality-test: Seek disconfirming evidence
3. **A**ttain distance: Overcome short-term emotion
4. **P**repare: Plan for failure scenarios
