## Foundational Concepts

### 1. Supply and Demand
**Principle**: Prices balance what sellers offer and buyers want.
- Higher price → more supply, less demand
- Equilibrium where curves cross
- Shifts vs movements along curve
- **Example**: Concert tickets: high demand + fixed supply = high price

### 2. Opportunity Cost
**Principle**: True cost is the best alternative foregone.
- Every choice has a hidden cost
- Money in savings costs market returns
- Time spent here can't be spent there
- **Example**: College degree costs tuition + 4 years of salary

### 3. Marginal Thinking
**Principle**: Evaluate decisions at the edge, not average.
- "Should I do one more unit?"
- Marginal cost vs marginal benefit
- Ignore sunk costs
- **Example**: Is the next employee worth their salary increase?

### 4. Comparative Advantage (Ricardo)
**Principle**: Specialize in what you do relatively best.
- Trade benefits both parties even if one is absolutely better at everything
- Relative efficiency, not absolute
- **Example**: Lawyer earning $500/hr shouldn't do $50/hr tasks even if faster

### 5. Diminishing Returns
**Principle**: Each additional unit provides less value than the previous.
- First slice of pizza > tenth slice
- Eventually more input yields less output
- **Example**: Third employee adds less than second

### 6. Economies of Scale
**Principle**: Cost per unit decreases as volume increases.
- Fixed costs spread across more units
- Specialization becomes worthwhile
- Limits: diseconomies of scale (coordination costs)
- **Example**: Manufacturing, software, infrastructure

## Market Dynamics

### 7. Invisible Hand (Smith)
**Principle**: Self-interest often produces socially beneficial outcomes.
- Price signals coordinate millions of decisions
- No central planner needed
- Requires competitive markets
- **Example**: Nobody orchestrates breakfast supply to NYC

### 8. Creative Destruction (Schumpeter)
**Principle**: Innovation destroys old industries while creating new ones.
- Essential to capitalism's dynamism
- Painful for incumbents
- **Example**: Digital photography destroying film industry

### 9. Externalities
**Principle**: Costs or benefits that fall on third parties.
- **Negative**: Pollution (cost to society, not producer)
- **Positive**: Education (benefits society beyond individual)
- Markets under/overproduce without correction
- **Example**: Factory pollution affecting nearby residents

### 10. Market Failure
**Principle**: Markets don't always produce optimal outcomes.
- Monopoly/oligopoly
- Information asymmetry
- Externalities
- Public goods
- **Example**: Healthcare markets with information asymmetry

### 11. Price Elasticity
**Principle**: How responsive quantity is to price changes.
- Elastic: small price change → large quantity change
- Inelastic: price changes, quantity doesn't
- **Example**: Insulin (inelastic) vs luxury goods (elastic)

### 12. Arbitrage
**Principle**: Profit from price differences of identical goods.
- Buy low, sell high, simultaneously
- Arbitrage tends to eliminate itself
- Information/transaction costs create opportunities
- **Example**: Currency arbitrage across markets

### 13. Bubbles and Crashes
**Principle**: Prices can detach from fundamentals.
- Reinforcing feedback: price rise → more buying → price rise
- Eventual correction when bubble bursts
- "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"
- **Example**: Dot-com bubble, housing bubble

## Incentives & Behavior

### 14. Incentives
**Principle**: "Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome." (Munger)
- People respond to incentives, often in unexpected ways
- Misaligned incentives → perverse behavior
- **Example**: Paying for lines of code → bloated code

### 15. Principal-Agent Problem
**Principle**: Agent's interests may differ from principal's.
- Agents have information advantage
- Monitoring is costly
- Solutions: align incentives, build trust, reduce information gap
- **Example**: CEO (agent) vs shareholders (principal)

### 16. Moral Hazard
**Principle**: People take more risk when insulated from consequences.
- Insurance reduces care taken
- Bailouts encourage risky behavior
- **Example**: Banks taking excessive risk knowing they'll be bailed out

### 17. Adverse Selection
**Principle**: Hidden information leads to market breakdown.
- Bad risks crowd out good risks
- "Lemons problem" in used cars
- Solutions: signaling, screening, guarantees
- **Example**: Health insurance attracting sick people

### 18. Tragedy of the Commons
**Principle**: Shared resources are over-exploited.
- Individual benefit, shared cost
- Each person's rational choice leads to collective ruin
- Solutions: privatization, regulation, norms
- **Example**: Overfishing, overgrazing, pollution

### 19. Free Rider Problem
**Principle**: People benefit without contributing.
- Public goods: can't exclude non-payers
- Under-provision of public goods
- **Example**: National defense, public radio

## Value & Pricing

### 20. Subjective Value
**Principle**: Value is in the eye of the beholder.
- Not intrinsic to the object
- Explains why trade is positive-sum
- **Example**: Baseball card worth $1 to one person, $10,000 to collector

### 21. Price Discrimination
**Principle**: Charge different prices to different segments.
- Capture more consumer surplus
- Requires: ability to segment, prevent resale
- **Example**: Student discounts, airline pricing

### 22. Bundling
**Principle**: Sell products together to capture varied preferences.
- Works when preferences are negatively correlated
- Reduces variance in willingness to pay
- **Example**: Cable TV packages, software suites

### 23. Network Effects
**Principle**: Value increases as more people use the product.
- Direct: phone network (more users = more people to call)
- Indirect: platform (more users = more developers = more apps)
- Winner-take-most dynamics
- **Example**: Social networks, operating systems

### 24. Two-Sided Markets
**Principle**: Platform connecting two interdependent user groups.
- Chicken-and-egg problem: need both sides
- Cross-side network effects
- **Example**: Credit cards (merchants + consumers), marketplaces

### 25. Switching Costs
**Principle**: Cost of changing from one product to another.
- Creates lock-in
- Source of pricing power
- **Example**: Changing banks, CRM systems, phone ecosystems

### 26. Auctions and Price Discovery
**Principle**: Markets that reveal willingness to pay.
- English: ascending bids
- Dutch: descending price
- Sealed-bid: one shot
- Vickrey: second-price
- **Example**: eBay, ad auctions, spectrum sales
