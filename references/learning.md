## Knowledge Acquisition

### 1. Circle of Competence
**Principle**: Know the boundaries of your knowledge.
- Inside circle: deep expertise, can make confident decisions
- Edge of circle: highest risk of overconfidence errors
- Outside circle: seek experts or abstain
- **Example**: Buffett investing only in businesses he understands

### 2. T-Shaped Knowledge
**Principle**: Deep expertise in one area + breadth across many.
- Vertical bar: deep specialization
- Horizontal bar: working knowledge of adjacent fields
- Enables cross-domain innovation
- **Example**: Designer who deeply knows UX + understands coding, business, psychology

### 3. Spacing Effect
**Principle**: Distributed practice beats massed practice.
- Study over time, not all at once
- Optimal spacing: review just as you're about to forget
- **Example**: 4 × 30min sessions > 1 × 2hr session

### 4. Testing Effect
**Principle**: Retrieval practice strengthens memory more than re-reading.
- Struggle to recall = stronger encoding
- Pretests improve learning even before instruction
- **Example**: Flashcards, practice questions, self-quizzing

### 5. Interleaving
**Principle**: Mix different topics or problem types during practice.
- Harder initially, better long-term transfer
- Forces discrimination between concepts
- **Example**: Practicing forehand, backhand, serve mixed vs blocked

### 6. Elaboration
**Principle**: Connect new information to existing knowledge.
- Ask "Why?" and "How does this relate to X?"
- Create meaningful associations
- **Example**: Explaining concept in your own words to someone else

### 7. Dual Coding
**Principle**: Combine verbal and visual representations.
- Words + images > words alone
- Mental imagery strengthens encoding
- **Example**: Diagrams with labels, concept maps

## Skill Development

### 8. Deliberate Practice (Ericsson)
**Principle**: Focused practice at edge of ability with feedback.
- Not mindless repetition
- Specific goals, immediate feedback, out of comfort zone
- **Requirements**: Established field, good teacher, designed exercises
- **Example**: Chess players studying specific positions, not just playing

### 9. 10,000 Hour Rule (Modified)
**Principle**: Expertise requires substantial practice—but quality matters.
- Hours alone don't guarantee expertise
- Must be deliberate practice, not routine
- Domain affects required time
- **Example**: Professional musicians average ~10K hours by age 20

### 10. Competence Ladder
**Principle**: Four stages of skill acquisition.
1. **Unconscious incompetence**: Don't know what you don't know
2. **Conscious incompetence**: Aware of gaps
3. **Conscious competence**: Can do with effort
4. **Unconscious competence**: Automatic, intuitive
- **Example**: Learning to drive

### 11. Plateau Effect
**Principle**: Skill improvement often stalls at "good enough."
- Automaticity prevents further growth
- Break through by returning to conscious practice
- **Example**: Typing speed plateaus without deliberate effort

### 12. Transfer of Learning
**Principle**: Skills learned in one context applied to another.
- **Near transfer**: Similar contexts (easy)
- **Far transfer**: Different contexts (rare, hard)
- Requires explicit practice of transfer
- **Example**: Chess expertise doesn't transfer to general reasoning

### 13. Zeigarnik Effect
**Principle**: Unfinished tasks stay in mind.
- Incompletion creates tension that aids memory
- Starting is often the hardest part
- **Example**: Cliffhangers in TV shows

## Adaptation & Growth

### 14. Growth vs Fixed Mindset (Dweck)
**Principle**: Beliefs about ability affect learning and persistence.
- **Fixed**: Ability is innate; failure means lack of talent
- **Growth**: Ability develops; failure is learning opportunity
- Mindset can be changed
- **Example**: "I can't do math" (fixed) vs "I can't do math yet" (growth)

### 15. Desirable Difficulties
**Principle**: Conditions that make learning harder but more durable.
- Spacing, interleaving, testing, generation
- Feels harder; works better
- **Example**: Varying practice conditions rather than repeating identical drills

### 16. Fail Fast, Learn Fast
**Principle**: Quick iteration beats extensive upfront planning.
- Errors are information
- Short feedback loops accelerate learning
- **Example**: MVP approach, rapid prototyping

### 17. Antifragility in Learning
**Principle**: Gain from stressors and challenges.
- Moderate stress improves performance
- Avoiding all difficulty = fragility
- **Example**: Muscles grow from stress, not rest alone

### 18. Explore/Exploit Trade-off
**Principle**: Balance trying new things vs leveraging known winners.
- Early: explore more (long horizon, cheap learning)
- Later: exploit more (short horizon, use knowledge)
- **Example**: Career: try different roles early, specialize later

### 19. Compounding Knowledge
**Principle**: Knowledge builds on knowledge exponentially.
- More you know, faster you learn related things
- Initial investment pays ongoing dividends
- **Example**: Learning a second programming language is easier than the first

## Teaching & Transfer

### 20. Feynman Technique
**Principle**: Explain simply to identify gaps.
1. Choose concept
2. Explain as if to a child
3. Identify gaps in explanation
4. Simplify and use analogies
- **Example**: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"

### 21. Analogical Reasoning
**Principle**: Understand new things through familiar comparisons.
- Surface similarities can mislead
- Structural similarities enable transfer
- **Example**: Electricity explained through water flow analogy

### 22. Scaffolding
**Principle**: Provide temporary support removed as competence grows.
- Training wheels, worked examples, hints
- Gradually reduce support
- **Example**: Math textbooks with decreasing guidance per problem

### 23. Cognitive Load Theory
**Principle**: Working memory is limited; design learning accordingly.
- Intrinsic load: inherent difficulty
- Extraneous load: poor design (reduce this)
- Germane load: schema building (promote this)
- **Example**: Simplify diagrams, reduce unnecessary information

### 24. Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky)
**Principle**: Optimal learning at edge of current ability.
- Too easy = boredom, no growth
- Too hard = frustration, failure
- Just right = flow, learning
- **Example**: Games that increase difficulty as player improves

### 25. Chunking
**Principle**: Group information into meaningful units.
- Working memory holds ~4 chunks
- Experts have larger chunks
- **Example**: Phone numbers chunked as 555-123-4567
