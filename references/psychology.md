## Cognitive Biases

### 1. Confirmation Bias
**Principle**: We seek/interpret information confirming existing beliefs.
- Notice supporting evidence; dismiss contradicting evidence
- Applies to information seeking and interpretation
- **Counter**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- **Example**: Only reading news sources that align with views

### 2. Availability Heuristic
**Principle**: Judge frequency by ease of recall.
- Recent, vivid, emotional events overweighted
- Leads to fear of plane crashes > car accidents
- **Counter**: Ask for base rates
- **Example**: Overestimating crime rates after watching news

### 3. Anchoring
**Principle**: First number disproportionately influences judgment.
- Even random anchors affect estimates
- Adjust insufficiently from starting point
- **Counter**: Generate your own estimate before seeing anchors
- **Example**: Sale prices anchored on original price

### 4. Hindsight Bias
**Principle**: Events seem predictable after they occur.
- "I knew it all along"
- Distorts learning from outcomes
- **Counter**: Record predictions before outcomes
- **Example**: Post-crisis: "Obviously the market would crash"

### 5. Overconfidence
**Principle**: We're more certain than we should be.
- Overestimate abilities, underestimate uncertainty
- Experts especially prone in certain domains
- **Counter**: Calibration training, wide confidence intervals
- **Example**: Planning fallacy—projects take longer than expected

### 6. Dunning-Kruger Effect
**Principle**: Incompetent people overestimate ability; experts underestimate.
- Lack skill to recognize lack of skill
- Experts know enough to see their gaps
- **Example**: Beginners confident; intermediates doubtful; masters appropriately confident

### 7. Status Quo Bias
**Principle**: Preference for current state over change.
- Loss aversion makes change feel risky
- Default options are powerful
- **Counter**: Actively evaluate whether current state is best
- **Example**: Staying in suboptimal job because switching is effortful

## Judgment & Perception

### 8. Framing Effects
**Principle**: Same information, different presentation → different conclusions.
- "90% survival" vs "10% mortality"
- Loss frame vs gain frame
- **Counter**: Reframe problems multiple ways
- **Example**: Tax as "penalty" vs "not receiving bonus"

### 9. Loss Aversion (Kahneman)
**Principle**: Losses hurt ~2x as much as equivalent gains feel good.
- Explains risk aversion for gains, risk seeking for losses
- Endowment effect: overvalue what we own
- **Example**: Reluctance to sell losing stocks

### 10. Peak-End Rule
**Principle**: Experiences judged by peak intensity and ending.
- Duration neglected
- Design experiences to end well
- **Example**: Vacation remembered by best moment and last day

### 11. Recency and Primacy Effects
**Principle**: First and last items in sequence remembered best.
- Middle items forgotten
- Order of information matters
- **Example**: First impression, last argument

### 12. Halo Effect
**Principle**: One positive trait colors perception of others.
- Attractive people judged smarter, more competent
- Successful companies' every decision seems brilliant
- **Counter**: Evaluate traits independently
- **Example**: "He's handsome, so he must be trustworthy"

### 13. Fundamental Attribution Error
**Principle**: Overweight personality, underweight situation for others' behavior.
- "They're lazy" vs "circumstances made it hard"
- Reverse for ourselves (self-serving bias)
- **Example**: Judging late colleague harshly without knowing context

### 14. Representativeness Heuristic
**Principle**: Judge probability by resemblance to stereotype.
- Ignore base rates
- Leads to conjunction fallacy
- **Example**: "She loves poetry, so she's probably an English major" (ignoring most students aren't)

## Social Psychology

### 15. Social Proof
**Principle**: We look to others to determine correct behavior.
- Uncertainty increases reliance
- "If everyone's doing it, it must be right"
- **Counter**: Evaluate independently first
- **Example**: Laugh tracks, long lines, testimonials

### 16. Authority Bias
**Principle**: Defer to perceived authority figures.
- Experts in one domain assumed experts in others
- Credentials create automatic trust
- **Counter**: Evaluate arguments, not just sources
- **Example**: Celebrity endorsements, doctor recommending investments

### 17. Liking Bias
**Principle**: More persuaded by people we like.
- Similarity, compliments, familiarity increase liking
- Used extensively in sales
- **Example**: Salespeople finding common ground

### 18. Commitment and Consistency (Cialdini)
**Principle**: Once committed, we strive to be consistent.
- Small commitments lead to larger ones
- Public commitments are stronger
- **Example**: Foot-in-the-door technique, asking for small favor first

### 19. In-Group/Out-Group Bias
**Principle**: Favor our group, disfavor outsiders.
- Minimal groups trigger bias
- Attribute positive to in-group, negative to out-group
- **Example**: Sports team loyalty, national preferences

### 20. Groupthink
**Principle**: Group harmony overrides critical evaluation.
- Dissent suppressed for cohesion
- Symptoms: overconfidence, stereotyping, self-censorship
- **Counter**: Appoint devil's advocate, anonymous input
- **Example**: Bay of Pigs, Challenger disaster

### 21. Bystander Effect
**Principle**: Less likely to help when others are present.
- Diffusion of responsibility
- Pluralistic ignorance (nobody acting = must be fine)
- **Counter**: Direct request to specific individual
- **Example**: "You in the red shirt, call 911"

## Motivation & Behavior

### 22. Incentive-Caused Bias
**Principle**: Unconsciously skew judgment toward personal benefit.
- Doctors prescribing profitable treatments
- Financial advisors recommending high-commission products
- **Counter**: Consider "whose incentive is this?"
- **Example**: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on not understanding it"

### 23. Reactance
**Principle**: Threatened freedom makes us want it more.
- "Don't do X" → desire to do X increases
- Scarcity increases desire
- **Example**: Banned books more popular, limited offers

### 24. Hedonic Treadmill
**Principle**: We adapt to changes and return to baseline happiness.
- Good and bad events have temporary effect
- Material gains don't produce lasting happiness
- **Example**: Lottery winners return to baseline happiness

### 25. Maslow's Hierarchy
**Principle**: Needs arranged in hierarchy; lower must be met first.
1. Physiological (food, water, shelter)
2. Safety (security, stability)
3. Belonging (love, relationships)
4. Esteem (respect, recognition)
5. Self-actualization (realizing potential)
- **Example**: Hard to focus on creativity when hungry

### 26. Self-Serving Bias
**Principle**: Attribute success to self, failure to external factors.
- Protects ego
- Opposite of fundamental attribution error applied to self
- **Example**: "I aced the test because I'm smart; I failed because it was unfair"

### 27. Sunk Cost Fallacy
See [decisions.md → #17 Sunk Cost Fallacy](decisions.md#17-sunk-cost-fallacy) — listed under Trade-off Analysis. In psychology context: driven by loss aversion and commitment bias.
