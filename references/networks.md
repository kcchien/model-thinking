## Network Structure

### 1. Nodes and Edges
**Principle**: Networks consist of entities (nodes) and connections (edges).
- Nodes: people, companies, websites, cells
- Edges: relationships, links, interactions
- Directed vs undirected edges
- **Example**: Social network (people + friendships)

### 2. Network Density
**Principle**: How connected is the network?
- Dense: most possible connections exist
- Sparse: few connections relative to possible
- Trade-off: dense = faster spread, redundancy; sparse = efficiency
- **Example**: Tight-knit community vs loose acquaintance network

### 3. Degree Distribution
**Principle**: How are connections distributed across nodes?
- Normal distribution: most nodes have similar connections
- Power law: few nodes have many connections (hubs)
- **Example**: Twitter followers follow power law (few mega-influencers)

### 4. Hub Nodes
**Principle**: Highly connected nodes that link many others.
- Disproportionate influence on network function
- Attack hubs to disrupt network
- **Example**: Major airports, influential people, key routers

### 5. Network Clustering
**Principle**: Tendency for connections to form clusters.
- Friends of friends are likely friends
- Communities within networks
- **Example**: Professional networks cluster by industry

### 6. Bridges and Structural Holes (Burt)
**Principle**: Connections between otherwise disconnected groups.
- Bridges access non-redundant information
- Structural holes = gaps that bridges span
- Brokers who span holes have informational advantage
- **Example**: Person connecting two departments

### 7. Strong vs Weak Ties (Granovetter)
**Principle**: Different tie strengths serve different functions.
- Strong ties: close friends, frequent contact, emotional support
- Weak ties: acquaintances, infrequent contact, novel information
- "Strength of weak ties": jobs found through acquaintances
- **Example**: Innovation often comes through weak ties

## Network Dynamics

### 8. Small World Networks
**Principle**: Most nodes reachable in few steps despite clustering.
- Six degrees of separation
- Local clustering + few long-distance ties
- **Example**: Social networks, neural networks, power grids

### 9. Preferential Attachment (Barabási)
**Principle**: Rich get richer; connected nodes attract more connections.
- New nodes prefer to connect to already-connected nodes
- Creates power law degree distribution
- First mover advantage
- **Example**: Popular websites get more links

### 10. Network Effects
**Principle**: Value of network increases with number of users.
- Direct: phone (more people to call)
- Indirect: platform (more users → more developers → more apps)
- Positive feedback loop → winner take all
- **Example**: Social networks, operating systems, payment systems

### 11. Critical Mass
**Principle**: Threshold beyond which network becomes self-sustaining.
- Below: network may collapse
- Above: growth becomes self-reinforcing
- **Example**: Fax machines useless until enough people had them

### 12. Tipping Points
**Principle**: Small changes can trigger large cascading effects.
- Non-linear transitions
- System crosses threshold
- **Example**: Trend going viral, market crash

### 13. Cascade Failures
**Principle**: Failure propagates through network connections.
- One node failure → neighbors overload → they fail
- Dense networks more vulnerable
- **Example**: Power grid blackouts, financial contagion

## Influence & Contagion

### 14. Social Contagion
**Principle**: Behaviors and ideas spread through social connections.
- Not just diseases: emotions, habits, opinions
- Influenced by connection strength and exposure frequency
- **Example**: Obesity, happiness, smoking spread through networks

### 15. Information Cascade
**Principle**: People copy others, ignoring private information.
- Early adopters' choices influence followers
- Can lock in suboptimal outcomes
- **Example**: Restaurant with few customers stays empty

### 16. Viral Spread
**Principle**: Content spreads exponentially through sharing.
- Reproduction number R: average shares per person
- R > 1: viral growth; R < 1: dies out
- **Example**: Memes, viral videos, rumors

### 17. Seeding Strategies
**Principle**: Where you start spreading matters.
- Seed influencers: reach through hubs
- Seed bridges: reach diverse groups
- Seed clusters: establish beachhead
- **Example**: Influencer marketing, early adopter programs

### 18. Echo Chambers
**Principle**: Networks amplify existing beliefs through homophily.
- Connect with similar others
- Information filtered by community
- Opposing views not encountered
- **Example**: Political polarization on social media

### 19. Dunbar's Number
**Principle**: Cognitive limit on stable social relationships (~150).
- Inner circle: ~5 close friends
- Sympathy group: ~15
- Band: ~50
- Tribe: ~150
- Beyond 150: institutions and formal structures needed
- **Example**: Optimal team sizes, organizational design

## Platform & Ecosystem

### 20. Two-Sided Markets
**Principle**: Platform connecting two interdependent user groups.
- Value comes from matching both sides
- Chicken-and-egg problem
- Cross-side network effects
- **Example**: Uber (riders + drivers), Airbnb (guests + hosts)

### 21. Multi-Sided Platforms
**Principle**: Platform serving more than two user groups.
- Each side adds value to others
- Complex pricing and subsidy decisions
- **Example**: Operating systems (users + developers + hardware makers)

### 22. Switching Costs and Lock-In
**Principle**: Costs that keep users on platform.
- Data migration, learning curve, social connections
- Creates moat once established
- **Example**: Phone number, email address, social graph

### 23. Disintermediation
**Principle**: Removing middlemen from value chain.
- Networks enable direct connections
- Intermediaries add value or get bypassed
- **Example**: Artists selling directly to fans

### 24. Network Orchestration
**Principle**: Coordinating network participants without owning assets.
- Set rules, provide infrastructure
- Capture value through position, not ownership
- **Example**: Apple App Store, Amazon Marketplace

### 25. Ecosystem Strategy
**Principle**: Create value through complementary relationships.
- Platform + complementors + users
- Grow the pie, capture fair share
- Cooperation and competition simultaneously (coopetition)
- **Example**: iPhone + App developers + users
